# Status of open science in Kenya: Data mining

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/BioinfoNet/Data-mining/master)

## Background
Goal: Data mining to discover trends in Open Science in Kenya

In the past we had a workshop held on 9th and 10th August 2017 at the KENET training room, Jomo Kenyatta Memorial Library, the University of Nairobi for more information visit this [github page](https://bioinfonet.github.io/OpenScienceKE/). This is one of the projects from the [#OpenScienceKEHackathon](https://github.com/BioinfoNet/OpenScienceKEHackathon). 


Find the schedule using this link [Open Science KE hackathon](https://github.com/BioinfoNet/OpenScienceKEHackathon/blob/master/hackathonschedule.md) and find the hackathon repository here [repository](https://github.com/BioinfoNet/OpenScienceKEHackathon). Initial discussions about the topics that will covered in the hackathon [open discussions](https://github.com/BioinfoNet/OpenScienceKEHackathon/issues)

See the data-mining report [here](data_analysis_report.md). 

## Agenda

We’ll be exploring various sources to discover the status of open science in Kenya. Are researchers using open source tools in their publications, is their work reproducible by providing all data, code and protocols to redo the experiment or observational study. We’ll search for papers in journals using search using tools for instance, 
1. [Article retriever](https://github.com/esohkevin/OpenScienceKEHackathon/blob/master/EDirect.md)
2. [pubmed.mineR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26564970)
3. [Text mining](https://gettingappy.shinyapps.io/wordcloudunigrams/) using an application written in R programming language to determine information content and searching for trends of particular keywords across the internet.
4. EBI web service https://europepmc.org/docs/EBI_Europe_PMC_Web_Service_Reference.pdf
5. NVM  https://europepmc.org/docs/EBI_Europe_PMC_Web_Service_Reference.pdf
6. code-cite https://github.com/softwaresaved/code-cite/blob/master/notebooks/getpapers.ipynb
7. Biopython https://biopython.org
